### Data Structures

#### Arrays

An array, also called a list in other programming languages, is a data structure allowing the storage of values in continuous spaces of memory. 

You can store different types of values such as integers, floats, objects or even other arrays (creating 2D or nd arrays) in them.

In PYTHON, lists are implemented as DYNAMIC ARRAYS, meaning you dontÂ´t need to specify the size of the arrays when declaration is performed.

*Time Complexities:*
* Lookup notation by index = O(1)
* Lookup by value = O(n)
* Array traversal = O(n)
* Array insertion = O(n)
* Array deletion = O(n)
